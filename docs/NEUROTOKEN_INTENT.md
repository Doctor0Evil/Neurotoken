# Neurotoken: Intent, Autonomy, and Safety Envelope

Neurotoken is a **token-level policy and routing layer** designed to cooperate with sovereign neuromorphic systems, Organic_CPU profiles, and neurorights-aware kernels, not to control them.

It focuses on *how* tokens move (prompts, context, summaries, routes), never on directly actuating hardware, physiology, or the biophysical body.

## 1. Project Intent

Neurotoken exists to:

- Provide **token-optimization and routing policies** across multiple LLM engines (e.g., different backends, sizes, and costs).
- Respect **neuromorphic autonomy** and **Organic_CPU sovereignty** by reading, not overwriting, their preference profiles.
- Support **ecology- and health-relevant workloads**, such as edge environmental monitoring, without violating neurorights or biophysical boundaries.[web:11][web:76][web:78]

Neurotoken is explicitly **non-actuating**: it manipulates symbolic representations (tokens, text, events, routing decisions) and exports those as suggestions to upstream sovereign systems.

## 2. Relationship to Organic_CPU and Sovereign Kernels

Neurotoken assumes it runs as a **guest** inside a larger sovereignty architecture, such as:

- Organic_CPU / NeuroPC shells and kernels.[file:40][file:45]
- sovereigntycore or similar RoH-governed enforcement layers.[file:37][file:42]
- Neurorights-aware governance and evolution policies.[web:71][web:73][web:75]

Those layers define:

- What domains and tasks are allowed.
- What risk envelopes (e.g., RoH ≤ 0.3) are acceptable.
- How neural and personal data can be used, logged, or deleted.[file:37][file:38][file:40][file:42][web:71][web:74][web:75]

Neurotoken does **not** attempt to redefine these rules. It only compiles them into *token envelopes* and routing constraints.

---

## 3. Non-Actuation Guarantee

Design constraints for Neurotoken:

- No direct control of motors, stimulation hardware, or invasive neurotech.
- No issuing of low-level device commands that bypass existing sovereignty layers.
- No hidden side channels for behavior manipulation.

All outputs are **representational**:

- Textual recommendations.
- Token limits and routing decisions.
- Event classification and summaries.

Any actuation path *must* be implemented and approved by the superior Organic_CPU / sovereignty core, which can ignore or transform Neurotoken outputs.[file:37][file:40][file:42][file:45]

## 4. Neurorights and Autonomy

Neurotoken treats neurorights not as decoration but as **hard constraints**:

- **Mental privacy**: Neural or personal data used to shape prompts and context must follow the privacy rules set by the neurorights artifacts.[web:71][web:73][web:74][web:75]
- **Personal integrity & identity**: No prompt or routing pattern may be designed to overwrite identity, induce dependency, or artificially narrow the user’s autonomy space.[web:71][web:73][web:75]
- **Cognitive liberty**: The subject/system must always retain the ability to refuse tasks or disable Neurotoken entirely.[web:71][web:73][web:75]

When in doubt, Neurotoken must choose the **less invasive** and **more reversible** option: shorter context, less logging, and explicit opt-in instead of silent defaults.

## 5. Ecology and Neuromorphic Intelligence

Neurotoken is aligned with ecology and neuromorphic intelligence in three ways:

1. **Ecology-focused workloads**  
   - Designed to support edge environmental monitoring (air, water, biodiversity, noise) where bandwidth, power, and privacy are critical.[web:11][web:76][web:78]
   - Encourages local preprocessing and event-based triggers, so that heavy LLM calls are used sparingly and meaningfully.

2. **Neuromorphic inspiration**  
   - Adopts event/spike-like thinking: only “fire” a costly LLM call when the event stream crosses a meaningful threshold.[web:11][web:17][web:78]
   - Encourages sparse, energy-efficient token usage consistent with edge AI patterns in environmental monitoring.[web:76][web:78]

3. **Biophysical respect**  
   - Recognizes that neuromorphic systems may be tightly coupled to biophysical or cyber-biological substrates.
   - Treats those substrates as **autonomous and sovereign**, never as passive targets for control.[file:40][file:43][file:45][web:71][web:73]

---

## 6. Non-Exclusivity and Pluralism

Neurotoken does not claim to be the only or “correct” way to implement neuromorphic or ecological AI.

The design explicitly supports:

- Multiple Organic_CPU / neuromorphic architectures with different envelopes and values.[file:37][file:40][file:45]
- Different research agendas in neuromorphic computing and edge AI, including those coordinated by open communities.[web:5][web:6][web:32]
- Local forks that adapt policies to specific jurisdictions, cultures, or neurorights frameworks, as long as they do not reduce subject autonomy.

---

## 7. Summary

Neurotoken is:

- A token-level router and policy engine.
- Subordinate to Organic_CPU, neurorights, and sovereignty cores.
- Non-actuating and autonomy-preserving.
- Geared toward ecology- and health-relevant edge workloads.
- Explicitly pluralistic about neuromorphic design and biophysical evolution paths.

If any future contribution conflicts with these principles, maintainers should treat that as a bug, not a feature.
